      "The decision by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi ) to lower position limits that can be taken in the futures and options (F&O) market will result in several stocks moving into the ban period from Monday, said analysts.These include stocks such as Adani Enterprises, Indiabulls Housing Finance Vodafone Idea, Jindal Steel & Power, Just Dial, NCC, Yes Bank , PVR and Punjab National Bank, among others.\n",
      "Sebi has increased margin requirements and capped derivatives exposure in a bid to curb volatility and short-selling in the equity markets.India’s main stock indices are down nearly 30 per cent from their lifetime high levels hit in January this year due to the worldwide panic triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.Sebi has brought down the market wide position limit in F&O contracts of a particular underlying stock to 50 per cent from 95 per cent earlier, subject to conditions, and also increased F&O margins where positions are higher above the revised cap.Market wide position limits (MWPL) may be revised to 50 per cent of existing levels if average daily price high-low variation percentage during the last five trading days is more than or equal to 15 per cent.\n",
      "An additional condition is that average MWPL utilisation percentage during this period should be more than or equal to 40 per cent.Research by Edelweiss showed that SAIL, Canara Bank IDFC First Bank, Escorts, GMR Infrastructure, Tata Motors and DLF are among the stocks with the highest open interest as a percentage of revised MWPL.\n",
      "A lower position limit would automatically push stocks with high open interest into the banned zone.Chandan Taparia, derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal said that Sebi’s move could somehow help the market to get stability.\n",

      "New Delhi: Telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio are set to benefit from a 10% jump in data traffic as more offices switch to ‘ work from home ’ (WFH) or people go into self-quarantine in their homes to combat the spread of Covid-19, BofA Global Research said in a report.“We consider Bharti/RIL to be bigger beneficiaries to this trend & expect both their mobile and fixed broadband business to benefit in near-term,” brokerage firm BofA Global Research said in the report on Monday.\n",
      "“As a pure-play telco Bharti is a bigger beneficiary.”India has 630 million plus mobile (3G/4G) users versus 19 million fixed broadband users.\n",
      "As fixed broadband penetration is 6%, majority of the WFH traffic, or about 70% plus, is expected to be on cellular network, the report said.ET had reported last week that demand for WiFi equipment including dongles and routers had more than doubled in March.“Airtel Home Broadband customers are now upgrading to faster speeds and larger quota plans to support work from home and study for home needs,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.Telcos and fixed broadband service providers are offering new plans to provide for the sudden spurt in demand.Airtel announced that it would not be charging for installation or security deposits for new users.\n",
      "ACT Fibernet has upgraded speeds to 300 Mbps and providing unlimited FUP (Fair Usage Policy) for March 2020 at no extra cost.\n",
      "BSNL is offering free of charge broadband for one month for those who have a BSNL landline.“Our checks indicate that even Jio (RIL) is seen a surge in new connections,” BofA said.However, the brokerage sees risks of some capex increase if WFH continues for a longer time.“Vendors we spoke to believe that networks are not equipped to handle sudden surge in traffic and hence may lead to sharp slowdowns in data speeds and may need heavy buffering in the near future,” BofA said in the report.\n",

      "It has assigned chief techcnology officer Randeep Sekhon as the pointsperson to drive coordination efforts from Airtel's end.The No 2 telco’s move comes on the quick heels of Bharti Airtel chairmam Sunil Mittal calling on the country’s Big 3 telcos to lay down their arms and come together to share networks to ensure all customers of the country are connected.Airtel said such an exercise would be particularly relevant, where a site is shut or where the TSP is not able to manage the up-time, wherein, the operators can collectively ensure that mobile and internet are not interrupted.Under the proposed ICR arrangement, mobile users will enjoy wider coverage of 2G, 3G and 4G services and better wireless internet speeds while roaming within a circle/metro.Airtel said at a time when the government has implemented social distancing measures through various interventions such as closure of commercial establishments, social centres, educational institutes and also advised work from home for offices/organisations, it is incumbent on the telecom industry to ensure continuous and uninterrupted availability of mobile and internet services, which are the backbone of the digital infrastructure.\n",

      "In yet another blow to the customers of crisis-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday (March 21) extended the regulatory restrictions on PMC for three more months till June 22, 2020.\n",
      "It may be recalled that a six-month regulatory restriction was placed on PMC Bank by RBI on September 23, 2019 after the detection of several financial irregularities, hiding and misreporting of loans given to banrupt real estate developer HDIL.\n",
      "Notably, the RBI has no powers to come up with a scheme for reconstruction of a crisis-hit cooperative bank but the central bank can do that for nationalised and commercial banks.\n",
      "The restrictions imposed by RBI came a blow to PMC Bank as it also stopped the bank from lending and accepting fresh deposits.\n",
      "The board and the management of the bank was also superseded by RBI and an ex-RBI official was appointed as the administrator at the bank to take care of the management of the bank and bring it out of the crisis.\n",
