# Web-Scraping
Just a basic mini-project to help some who wants to get started with static and real time web-scraping!

## Libraries Used:
1. Bs4 (for Beautiful Soup)
2. urllib
3. nltk
4. time
5. pandas
6. stockstats


## 1. Scraping Google news (Static web-scraping)
-> Fetching the article.

-> Creating 2 dictionaries to seprate main and sub news.

-> Getting the Title.

-> Getting the summary.

## 2. Scraping moneycontrol.com (Dynamic/Real-time web-scraping)
-> Creating a function which scrapes data after a given interval for a given time period

-> Alerting the user whenever there is a difference of more than 2% in any stock

-> Storing the data in a 3d list for implementing stock stats



#### P.S. As I don't have much knowledge on stock marketing indicators, please ignore my mistakes.
#### Any suggestion is highly appreciated!
